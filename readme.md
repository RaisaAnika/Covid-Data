## Cross-Validation and Ridge Regression for COVID-19 Prediction

This code snippet demonstrates how to perform k-fold cross-validation and ridge regression for predicting COVID-19 cases.
Ridge regression is used  to build a predictive model for COVID-19 cases while addressing issues such as overfitting and multicollinearity, ultimately improving the model's ability to generalize to new data.

### Data 
- The data consist of two attributes: week and number of cases in both train and test data.
- The data is in form of String.

### Data Preparation
- The provided train and test data are converted from strings to numpy arrays.
- Features (weeks) and target values (number of cases) are separated for both train and test data.
- Data normalization is performed separately for train and test data.

### Cross-Validation
- We define the number of folds (example: k = 15) for cross-validation.
- For each alpha value in the list of alphas to try, we iterate over each fold:
  - For each fold, a validation set is created by slicing the data appropriately.
  - The remaining data is used as the training set.
  - Polynomial features (up to degree 2) are added to both the training and validation sets.
  - The model parameters (theta) are computed using ridge regression with the closed-form solution.
  - Predictions are made on the validation set using the trained model.
  - The RMSE (root mean squared error) is calculated for each fold.
- The average RMSE across all folds is computed for each alpha value.
- The alpha value that results in the lowest average RMSE is selected as the best alpha.

### Model Training and Testing
- Once the best alpha is determined, the model is trained on the entire training data using the selected alpha.
- Polynomial features (up to degree 2) are added to both the training and test sets.
- The model parameters (theta) are computed using ridge regression with the closed-form solution.
- Predictions are made on the test set using the trained model.
- The RMSE is calculated to evaluate the performance of the model on the test set.
